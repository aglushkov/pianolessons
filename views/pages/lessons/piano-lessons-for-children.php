            <p>Anastasiya works on a one-to-one basis with children from as young as 5 years old.</p>
            <p>In her own unique way Anastasiya emphasises the fun aspect of learning when it comes to giving piano lessons for children so young. This is crucial when working with young pupils, where their attention span is less than that of the older child.</p>
            <p>Anastasiya encourages the involvement of the parent in the initial stage of learning. By sitting in on a few first piano lessons, parents can get a better idea of how to guide and motivate their children's practice at home. When teacher, parent and child are working as a team, the progress and success of the young student is guaranteed.</p>
            <p>The child's interest is maintained through a wide variety of musical styles and repertoire. So whatever their preferences are, whether it be classical, popular, baroque or jazz, all are catered for.</p>

            <p>Students will be taught how to practice at home in an effective way and will leave each of their piano lessons knowing exactly how to prepare for the next one.</p>
            <p>Music, and in particular playing piano, is much more then a hobby. The disciplines acquired and developed in achieving the students' musical goals can be applied to other aspects of their personal development. It enhances their confidence, memory, problem solving and fine motor skills.</p>
            <p>Over the years, Anastasiya's students, no matter what age they are, have prepared for and completed grade examinations, both the Royal Irish Academy and Associated Board. They have always achieved excellent results and exceeded their own expectations, with all of them getting either Honours or Distinctions.</p>

            <p>Students, who have prepared for Junior Certificate Music and Leaving Certificate Music in their lessons with Anastasiya, have also achieved excellent results. </p>
            <p>Anastasiya can prepare students for participation in music festivals and competitions, such as Feis Ceoil, if they wish.</p>

            <p>Living in Dublin City provides a wonderful opportunity to explore musical and cultural events. Anastasiya encourages students to attend live performances and concerts, as well as performing for family and friends.</p>
