            <p>Anastasiya can prepare students for both Junior and Leaving Certificates Music.</p>
            <p>If you don't have Music as part of your school curriculum, Anatasiya can prepare you for all three aspects of the exam syllabus: Performance, Composition and Listening.</p>
            <p>If, however, music is on the school curriculum, then one-to-one lessons with Anastasiya can give the student the extra help required for a better understanding of any aspect of the exam.</p>
            <p>One-to-one lessons, as opposed to the group setting, that is mostly offered, are much more effective, because they are tailored exactly for the individual needs of the particular student. </p>
