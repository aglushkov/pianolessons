                Charlotte, Marianna, Alexei and Alexandar took part in the Emerging Artists concert,
                part of the Festival of Russian Culture, at Hugh Lane Gallery (Dublin).

                The concert was a gathering of up and coming young musicians from all over Ireland,
                performing music of Russian composers.
            </p>

                What a great privilege and honour that four of Anastasiya's students were picked for this prestigious event!
